# Sociopath: Unlocking Social Media Insights with Data-Driven Analytics

**Sociopath** is a basic analytics module for analyzing engagement data from mock social media accounts. The project aims to evaluate social media post performance by analyzing engagement metrics like likes, shares, and comments. It uses Langflow for workflow automation, DataStax Astra DB for database operations, and GPT integration for generating insights.

## Tools & Technologies

- **React** (with Shadcn)
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite**
- **Recharts** (for data visualization)
- **DataStax Astra DB** (for database operations)
- **Langflow** (for workflow creation and GPT integration)
- **Gemini Integration** (for generating insights)

## Features

1. **Fetch Engagement Data**: Simulated dataset for social media engagement (likes, shares, comments, post types).
2. **Post Performance Analysis**: Calculate average engagement metrics for different post types (carousel, reels, static images).
3. **Insight Generation**: Use GPT to generate simple insights based on the analysis (e.g., which post type performs better).
